SASE UMBC VR project winter 2018
Objective: Create a team-based Virtual Reality game which can host up to teams of _X_ people. Each individual will see their own, unique control panel and a changing set of instructions. The instructions ask for changes of a certain control (which is unique to one person, not limited to the person with the instructions). Players must communicate quickly and efficently to pass through each stage.    

Based in C++, created by Harrison Ratcilffe(https://github.com/hhratcliffe), Andrew Le (manager), Parth Patel(__insert github prof__), Sean Custer (__insert github prof__), Kristen Loo (__insert github prof__), Ji Hun Lee (__insert github prof__), Hanton Trinh (__insert github prof__) 

dependencies include:  unreal engine, the game engine (https://www.unrealengine.com/download?dismiss=null); [for windows users] cygwin, a c++ compiler (https://cygwin.com/install.html); a text editor/IDE of choice (I use sublime https://www.sublimetext.com/ and compile in consule, some people use IDE's like visual studio to do both);   

This game was inspired by mobile phone game "SPACETEAM" (https://www.playspaceteam.com/).
